## 🚀Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform

A full-stack Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform that allows multiple organizations (tenants) to securely share the same application while keeping their data isolated. The system supports role-based access, project management, and centralized administration using modern web technologies.


 ## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how real-world SaaS applications work using multi-tenancy architecture, role-based authentication, and containerized deployment.
It is designed for learning, demonstration, and academic evaluation.
